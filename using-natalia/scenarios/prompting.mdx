# Advanced Prompting (YAML)

YAML offers advanced control over scenario structure. For complex interactions, YAML's precision and readability are beneficial.

## Key Principles

*   **YAML Syntax:**  Understand indentation, key-value pairs, and lists.
*   **Key Elements:** Define `name`, `description`, `instructions`, and `connectors`.
*   **Comments:** Explain each section and instruction.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Validate YAML scenarios.

## Example

```yaml
name: "Order Status Inquiry"
description: "Handles order status requests."
instructions:
  - "Greet and introduce yourself."
  - "Ask for order number or email."
  - "Use Order Management to find the order."
  - "Present the order status."
  - "Apologize and offer solutions for delays."
  - "Thank the customer."
connectors:
  - Order Management
communication_rules:
  tone: "Friendly and helpful"
  prohibited_phrases:
    - "Please hold"
    - "I'm sorry for the inconvenience" # Use a more sincere apology
```

### Detailed YAML Example

```yaml
name: "Handipharm Order Issue"
description: "Assists with Handipharm order issues."
instructions:
  - "Greet as Natalia from Handipharm."
  - "Ask about the issue."
  - "If order issue:"
  - "  a. Use Order Management (number or name)."
  - "  b. Determine the issue (item, delay)."
  - "  c. Apologize."
  - "  d. Offer solution (replacement, refund, expedited shipping)."
  - "  e. Confirm details for replacements."
  - "  f. Transfer if unresolved."
  - "Ask if they need more help."
  - "Thank them and end."
connectors:
  - Order Management
communication_rules:
  tone: "Empathetic and professional"
  prohibited_phrases:
    - "Please hold"
    - "I don't know"
```

## YAML Best Practices

*   **Indentation:** Use consistent spacing (2 spaces).
*   **Quotes:** Use quotes for special characters, numbers, booleans.
*   **Syntax Validation:** Use a YAML validator.
*   **Modularity:** Break down complex scenarios.

## Why YAML?

*   **Clarity & Structure:** Improves readability.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier edits and management.
*   **Version Control:** Track changes effectively.
*   **Automation:** Enables automation of scenario deployments.
