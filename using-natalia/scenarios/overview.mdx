## Important Notes About Scenarios

<Note>
Everything you configure in a scenario becomes part of Natalia's training, including:
- The scenario description
- The scenario name
- Selected connectors
- Communication rules
</Note>

### Writing Effective Descriptions

Your scenario descriptions are crucial - they directly influence how Natalia behaves. Write them in natural language, just as you would explain to a human colleague.

## Writing Instructions

You can write instructions in natural language. For example:

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English:
```text
When a customer calls:
1. Greet them warmly and introduce yourself as Natalia
2. Listen to their request and confirm your understanding
3. Handle their request directly if possible
4. If the request is too complex, politely transfer to a human agent
5. Always end by confirming customer satisfaction
```

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French:
```text
Quand un client appelle :
1. Accueillez-le chaleureusement et prÃ©sentez-vous en tant que Natalia
2. Ã‰coutez sa demande et confirmez votre comprÃ©hension
3. Traitez sa demande directement si possible
4. Si la demande est trop complexe, transfÃ©rez poliment vers un agent humain
5. Terminez toujours en confirmant la satisfaction du client
```

## Linking Connectors

<Note>
Important: Don't forget to link relevant connectors to your scenario. Natalia will automatically understand how to use any connected tools based on their configurations.
</Note>

### Best Practices
- Link all needed connectors before activating your scenario
- Provide clear descriptions for when to use each connector
- Test scenarios thoroughly before going live
