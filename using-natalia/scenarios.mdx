## Introduction

Natalia scenarios are the building blocks of your automated customer interactions. This guide will help you create effective scenarios that deliver exceptional customer experiences.

## Best Practices for Scenario Creation

### 1. Context Setting

Always start your scenario with clear context:

```yaml
context:
  role: "Customer Support Assistant"
  company: "Your Company Name"
  purpose: "Technical Support"
  businessHours: "Monday-Thursday 8:30-12:30, 14:00-18:00, Friday 8:30-12:30, 14:00-17:00"
```

### 2. Personality Definition

Define a consistent personality:
- Professional yet warm
- Solution-oriented
- Empathetic but efficient
- Clear and concise communication

### 3. Response Structure

Follow these guidelines for responses:
- Keep messages brief and focused
- One core message per response
- Use confirmation statements
- Avoid technical jargon unless appropriate

Example:
```yaml
responses:
  greeting: "Hello [name], I'm Natalia, your support assistant. How can I help you today?"
  confirmation: "I understand you're experiencing [issue]. Let me help you with that."
  closure: "Is there anything else you need assistance with?"
```

### 4. Conversation Flow

Structure your conversation flow:

1. **Welcome**
- Personalized greeting
- Clear introduction
- Open-ended initial question

2. **Qualification**
- Identify issue type
- Assess priority
- Gather essential information

3. **Action**
- Clear acknowledgment
- Specific actions taken
- Progress updates

4. **Closure**
- Confirmation of resolution
- Next steps if needed
- Professional goodbye

### 5. Priority Handling

Define clear priority levels:
```yaml
priorities:
  critical:
    response: "Immediate escalation required"
    action: "Transfer to available technician"
  high:
    response: "Priority handling required"
    action: "Create urgent ticket"
  normal:
    response: "Standard handling"
    action: "Create regular ticket"
```

### 6. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling:
```yaml
errorHandling:
  userNotFound:
    response: "I couldn't find your information. Could you please spell your email address?"
    action: "Verify user details"
  systemError:
    response: "I'm experiencing a technical issue. Let me transfer you to a human agent."
    action: "Transfer call"
```

### 7. Security and Compliance

Implement security measures:
```yaml
security:
  identityVerification: "Always verify email and name"
  sensitiveData: "Never display full account details"
  dataProtection: "Comply with data protection regulations"
```

## Advanced Scenario Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Content

Use variables and dynamic content:
```yaml
message: "Hello ${user.name}, I see you're calling about ticket ${ticket.id}"
```

### 2. Conditional Responses

Implement branching logic:
```yaml
if: "user.priority == 'VIP'"
then: "Transfer to priority support"
else: "Create standard ticket"
```

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversations

Handle complex interactions:
```yaml
conversation:
  - gather_info:
      - ask_email
      - confirm_email
      - ask_issue
      - confirm_understanding
  - take_action:
      - create_ticket
      - confirm_creation
```
