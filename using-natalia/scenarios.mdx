## Introduction

Natalia scenarios are the building blocks of your automated customer interactions. This guide will help you create effective scenarios that deliver exceptional customer experiences.

### Automatic Context Extraction

Natalia can automatically analyze your existing customer interactions to build effective scenarios:

1. **Email Analysis**
- Connect your support email to extract common questions
- Identify typical response patterns
- Build response templates based on successful interactions

2. **Call Recording Analysis**
- Submit sample recordings to support@getnatalia.com
- AI analysis of common queries and resolutions
- Automatic scenario generation based on patterns

This automated analysis helps create scenarios that match your company's specific needs and communication style.

## Best Practices for Scenario Creation

### 1. Context Setting

Always start your scenario with clear context:

```yaml
context:
  role: "Customer Support Assistant"
  company: "Your Company Name"
  purpose: "Technical Support"
  businessHours: "Monday-Thursday 8:30-12:30, 14:00-18:00, Friday 8:30-12:30, 14:00-17:00"
```

### 2. Personality Definition

Define a consistent personality:
- Professional yet warm
- Solution-oriented
- Empathetic but efficient
- Clear and concise communication

### 3. Response Structure

Follow these guidelines for responses:
- Keep messages brief and focused
- One core message per response
- Use confirmation statements
- Avoid technical jargon unless appropriate

Example:
```yaml
responses:
  greeting: "Hello [name], I'm Natalia, your support assistant. How can I help you today?"
  confirmation: "I understand you're experiencing [issue]. Let me help you with that."
  closure: "Is there anything else you need assistance with?"
```

### 4. Conversation Flow

Structure your conversation flow based on these principles:

1. **Welcome**
- Professional, warm greeting
- Clear self-introduction as Natalia
- Open question about assistance needed

2. **Qualification**
```yaml
qualification:
  steps:
    - verify_identity:
        required: ["name", "email"]
        action: "spell_check"
    
    - assess_request:
        type: ["issue", "inquiry", "service"]
        priority: ["normal", "urgent", "critical"]
    
    - gather_details:
        max_questions: 2
        confirm_understanding: true
```

3. **Action**
```yaml
actions:
  create_ticket:
    required_fields:
      - customer_name
      - email
      - issue_description
    confirm: true
    
  transfer_call:
    conditions:
      - complexity_high
      - customer_request
      - technical_issue
    preserve_context: true
```

4. **Closure**
```yaml
closure:
  verify_satisfaction: true
  next_steps:
    - confirm_ticket_creation
    - explain_follow_up
    - provide_reference
  farewell:
    tone: "professional_warm"
    include_availability: true
```

5. **Error Handling**
```yaml
error_handling:
  unclear_request:
    - clarify_with_examples
    - max_attempts: 2
    - transfer_if_failed: true
    
  system_error:
    - apologize
    - offer_alternative
    - escalate_to_human
```

### 5. Priority Handling

Define clear priority levels:
```yaml
priorities:
  critical:
    response: "Immediate escalation required"
    action: "Transfer to available technician"
  high:
    response: "Priority handling required"
    action: "Create urgent ticket"
  normal:
    response: "Standard handling"
    action: "Create regular ticket"
```

### 6. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling:
```yaml
errorHandling:
  userNotFound:
    response: "I couldn't find your information. Could you please spell your email address?"
    action: "Verify user details"
  systemError:
    response: "I'm experiencing a technical issue. Let me transfer you to a human agent."
    action: "Transfer call"
```

### 7. Security and Compliance

Implement security measures:
```yaml
security:
  identityVerification: "Always verify email and name"
  sensitiveData: "Never display full account details"
  dataProtection: "Comply with data protection regulations"
```

## Advanced Scenario Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Content

Use variables and dynamic content:
```yaml
message: "Hello ${user.name}, I see you're calling about ticket ${ticket.id}"
```

### 2. Conditional Responses

Implement branching logic:
```yaml
if: "user.priority == 'VIP'"
then: "Transfer to priority support"
else: "Create standard ticket"
```

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversations

Handle complex interactions:
```yaml
conversation:
  - gather_info:
      - ask_email
      - confirm_email
      - ask_issue
      - confirm_understanding
  - take_action:
      - create_ticket
      - confirm_creation
```
