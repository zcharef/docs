## Introduction

Natalia scenarios are the building blocks of your automated customer interactions. This guide will help you create effective scenarios that deliver exceptional customer experiences. Everything you configure in a scenario becomes part of Natalia's training, including the scenario description, name, selected connectors, and communication rules.

### Automatic Context Extraction

Natalia can automatically analyze your existing customer interactions to build effective scenarios:

1. **Email Analysis** (Coming soon)
   - Connect your support email to extract common questions
   - Identify typical response patterns
   - Build response templates based on successful interactions

2. **Call Recording Analysis**
   - Submit sample recordings to support@getnatalia.com
   - AI analysis of common queries and resolutions
   - Automatic scenario generation based on patterns

This automated analysis helps create scenarios that match your company's specific needs and communication style.

## Writing Effective Descriptions

Your scenario descriptions are crucial - they directly influence how Natalia behaves. Write them in natural language, just as you would explain to a human colleague. Be specific and clear about the purpose of the scenario, the expected interactions, and the desired outcomes. The description you provide is automatically added to Natalia's training.

## Writing Instructions

You can write instructions in natural language. For example:

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English:
```text
When a customer calls:
1. Greet them warmly and introduce yourself as Natalia
2. Listen to their request and confirm your understanding
3. Handle their request directly if possible
4. If the request is too complex, politely transfer to a human agent
5. Always end by confirming customer satisfaction
```

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French:
```text
Quand un client appelle :
1. Accueillez-le chaleureusement et prÃ©sentez-vous en tant que Natalia
2. Ã‰coutez sa demande et confirmez votre comprÃ©hension
3. Traitez sa demande directement si possible
4. Si la demande est trop complexe, transfÃ©rez poliment vers un agent humain
5. Terminez toujours en confirmant la satisfaction du client
```

## Linking Connectors and Phone Numbers

A scenario is linked to a specific phone number. When setting up a scenario, you will select which phone number it should be associated with. This means that Natalia will use the chosen scenario to handle all calls coming to that particular number. Choose your scenarios carefully based on the purpose of each phone number.

Phone numbers can't be automatically ordered yet. To obtain a new phone number or if you have any questions, please contact us at support@getnatalia.com. We'll be happy to assist you.

Connectors enhance Natalia's capabilities by providing access to external tools and data. Important: Don't forget to link relevant connectors to your scenario. Natalia will automatically understand how to use any connected tools based on their configurations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Connectors">
    Open your scenario settings and navigate to the Connectors section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Connectors">
    Choose the connectors needed for your scenario:
    - REST API for custom integrations
    - Call Transfer for human handoff
    - More connectors coming soon
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure">
    Set up each connector's specific settings. Tell Natalia *when* to use each connector in natural language. Explain *why* and *how* each connector contributes to the scenario.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Principles for Connector Integration

* **Relevance:** Choose connectors aligned with the scenario's goal.
* **Configuration:** Ensure connectors are set up correctly with credentials and settings.
* **Clear Instructions:** Tell Natalia *when* to use each connector in natural language.
* **Thorough Testing:** Validate connector functionality within the scenario.
* **Purposeful Descriptions:** Explain *why* and *how* each connector contributes to the scenario.

## Examples of Connector Integration within Scenarios

### Order Management

```text
1. Greet the customer as Natalia.
2. Ask for their order number or email.
3. Use the **Order Management connector** to find the order.
4. Present order details (status, items, shipping, delivery).
5. If the order isn't found, ask them to double-check the information.
6. For order changes (returns, address updates), follow scenario steps.
```

### Product Catalog

```text
1. Greet the customer.
2. Ask for the product name or SKU.
3. Use the **Product Catalog connector** to find the product.
4. Present details (price, availability, specs, images).
5. If no product is found, suggest alternatives or connect to sales.
6. For recommendations, use the connector's recommendation engine.
```

### Knowledge Base

```text
1. Greet the customer.
2. Ask for a description of the technical issue.
3. Use the **Knowledge Base connector** to search for solutions.
4. Present articles and troubleshooting steps.
5. If unresolved, create a support ticket and transfer to a tech agent.
```

###  ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French Example - Gestion des Commandes

```text
1. Saluez le client en tant que Natalia.
2. Demandez le numÃ©ro de commande ou l'email.
3. Utilisez le **connecteur Gestion des Commandes** pour trouver la commande.
4. PrÃ©sentez les dÃ©tails (statut, articles, livraison).
5. Si la commande est introuvable, demandez de vÃ©rifier les informations.
6. Pour les modifications, suivez les Ã©tapes du scÃ©nario.
```

Link all necessary connectors *before* activating your scenario.
