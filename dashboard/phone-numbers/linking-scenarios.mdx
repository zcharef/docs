## Understanding the Connection

Each phone number in your Natalia account must be linked to a specific scenario. This connection determines how Natalia handles calls to that number.

### Important Considerations

- One scenario per phone number
- Choose scenarios carefully based on the number's purpose
- Consider your customer journey when selecting scenarios
- Test thoroughly before going live
