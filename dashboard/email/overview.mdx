## Email Integration

Natalia automates your email communications by generating draft responses for all incoming emails. The system aims to minimize human intervention - you'll only need to review and approve drafts before sending. While occasional adjustments may be needed, the goal is to reduce your workload to a simple final validation.

### Microsoft 365 Setup
If you're using Microsoft 365 and are not a tenant administrator:
1. Your tenant administrator must first log into the Natalia dashboard using their admin credentials
2. They need to authorize the Natalia application through your tenant
3. After authorization, you can log in with your own account

### Automatic Context Learning
Want Natalia to learn from your existing communications? Once you've logged in, contact support@getnatalia.com to enable our Automatic Company Context and Interactions Extraction. We'll analyze your sent and received emails to create a tailored Natalia scenario that matches your company's communication style and needs.
